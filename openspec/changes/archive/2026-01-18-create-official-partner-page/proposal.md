# Proposal: Create Official Partner Page

## Why
A dedicated "Official Partner" page is crucial for recognizing valuable contributors to JADE 2026 and showcasing their support. It provides transparency and adds credibility to the event.

## What Changes
- Create a new route for the "Official Partner" page at `/official-partners`.
- Develop a new Livewire component to render the page content.
- Integrate an image placeholder to represent the list of official partners.
- Style the page and the image placeholder using Tailwind CSS, HyperUI, and daisyUI to align with the website's "Elegant and Sophisticated" visual aesthetic.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `official-partner-page-content`.
- Affected code: `routes/web.php`, `resources/views/livewire/official-partners.blade.php`.
