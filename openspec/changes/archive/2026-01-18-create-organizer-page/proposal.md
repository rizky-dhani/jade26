# Proposal: Create Organizer Page

## Why
A dedicated "Organizer" page is essential to provide transparency and build credibility for JADE 2026. It allows stakeholders to understand the background and expertise of WKCI, reinforcing trust in the event's organization.

## What Changes
- Create a new route for the "Organizer" page at `/organizer`.
- Develop a new Livewire component to render the page content.
- Populate the page with a brief, professional introduction to WKCI, including their role as the organizer of JADE 2026.
- Style the page using Tailwind CSS, HyperUI, and daisyUI to align with the website's "Elegant and Sophisticated" visual aesthetic.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `organizer-page-content`.
- Affected code: `routes/web.php`, `resources/views/livewire/organizer.blade.php`.
